# Final_ProgrammingII
Final Project for programming II Course.
To use on an android smartphone, install the app kivy launcher, and create a folder called "kivy" in the home directory of the 
phone. Once that is done, create a subfolder preferably with the name of this app, which will be the repository of the actual
program. Finally, run kivy launcher, select Student Database, and the app will run.

-Note, some phones may crash the app when printing the CSV file. If everything runs smoothly, the CSV will either be a prompted download on screen or automatically be stored in the repository you created. 

-In usage, only press load once when starting. Multiple times may heed undesired results.

-Saving occurs automatically with every replacement, submission, and deletion. Loading at the beginning however is manual. It does not have to be, and I may remove it later easily, it is just there for testing purposes.
